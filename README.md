# Data-Driven_Crime_Prevention
## Abstract
Having the ability to forecast crime statistics in a region can greatly benefit decision making of law enforcement leaders and policymakers. This paper presents the process of generating county-level forecasts for crime statistics by developing and evaluating machine learning models based on a combination of incident-based crime data for the state of Virginia, USA, and complementary demographic datasets. With the type of offense as the supervised variable, our models revealed that the types of crime that occur most frequently in a county are strongly influenced by the hour of incident, weekday, day of month, and month as well as county population and median housing price. In order to create a prototype, we exported the model into an interactive dashboard, through which users can extract actionable insights and forecasts of crime statistics.
